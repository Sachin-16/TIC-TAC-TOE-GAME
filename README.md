# TIC-TAC-TOE-GAME
This is my first andriod game

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The goal of the game is to be the first player to get three of their symbols (X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This repository contains a command-line version of the Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python. It allows two players to play the game on a terminal.
