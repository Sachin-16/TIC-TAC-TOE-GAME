# TIC-TAC-TOE-GAME
This is my first andriod game

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The goal of the game is to be the first player to get three of their symbols (X or O) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This repository contains a command-line version of the Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python. It allows two players to play the game on a terminal.

#HOW-TO-PLAY

The game starts with an empty 3x3 grid.

Each player takes turns to make a move.

The first player is assigned symbol 'X', and the second player is assigned symbol 'O'.

The players enter their moves by specifying the row and column of the cell they want to mark. Rows and columns are numbered from 0 to 2.

The game validates the moves and updates the grid accordingly.

The game continues until one player wins by getting three of their symbols in a row, or the game ends in a draw (no more empty cells on the grid).

After the game ends, the players have the option to play again or exit the game.
